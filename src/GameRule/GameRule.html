            In normal game, you need to place your ships first and generate AI fleet, then click start to begin. You will attack first and AI would attack after your move. The one who first sunk all opponent's ship would win.

        <div class='modeIntro'>
            In free game, you do not need to place your ships, and AI would not attack. You can freely attack AI's ship, and when all ships are sunk, you win.
