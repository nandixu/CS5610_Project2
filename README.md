# Writeup of Project2 BattleShip Nandi Xu:

## Notice on the development of the game:
The game is composed of two parts: the free game is made in React, and the normal game is made in JS. The access to free game and everything else excecpt 
normal game are fine, and using npm start command would simply launch the app. Users have to click NormalGame.html in NormalGame folder to start normal
game. I have presented this question to Hunter and a solution was not made yet. However, the basic functions of two game modes are eligible.
The normal game mode was based on the concept from a youtuber, link is presented at the end. I learned and used a lot of technics in the videos so I wish to 
demonstrate this thing first.
One more thing is the repo issue. I uploaded the original version on the day of deadline, and I accidentally deleted the repo when I was trying to make a porfolio
and fix the 404 errors on Github Page. I immediatelly noticed Hunter, Lukai, and Shaun this issue and asked for a solution. An email with the new repo link is sent to
instruction team as well. The repo you see now is a new one, and please let me know if this issue would have any effect on the submission and grade of the project. 
Thank you!

## Challenges:
     The biggest challenge is the main scope of the game. I literally rebuilt the game 3-4 times, and every time I restart everything, it was an absolute new experience. 
In the final version, the game contains two parts that have two different structures: the free game is made in React, and the normal game is made in JS. I wish these
two different built structure could demonstrate the capability of using html, css, JS, React, and Redux.

## Additional Features:
    I would write a smart AI that could move based on player's action.

## Assumptions I made:
    The players do not click on weird places, do not click a square 100 times per second, and hopefully follow the instructions.

## How long does it take:
    30+ hours in three weeks

## Bonus points:
    I tried out both bonus points. Drag and drop is implemented in normal game, and uses event listeners in JS. Local storage was implemented in Free Game by Redux
